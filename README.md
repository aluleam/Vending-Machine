# Vending-Machine
We developed a vending machine using a 9-state Moore machine in SystemVerilog, compiled with Quartus, and implemented on a DE-10 Lite FPGA board. The machine accepts various coin inputs and dispenses gruel with correct change, designed for our CSC 244: Digital Logic Design course.
